== Introduction ==

=== Abstract ===

This document proposes a standard for the [https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261.pdf FROST] multi-signature scheme and [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html RFC9591] specification, with some modifications to the signature process in order to support [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki BIP340] public keys and signatures.

These modifications include:
* Specifying a domain for the BIP340 cryptography (secp256k1-bip340).
* Modifying the FROST challenge message to use the BIP340 challenge format.
* The use of x-only public keys, and possible negation for these keys during signing.
* The use of an x-only group public nonce, and possible negation for this nonce during signing.
* The ''tweaking'' of the aggregate signature, in order to derive [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki BIP32] child keys and create [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki BIP341] Taproot outputs with key and script paths.

The standard for these modifications can be derived from [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki BIP327], as both Musig2 and FROST follow a similar scheme for signing and aggregation.

=== Motivation ===

FROST is a schnorr-based, k-of-n multi-signature scheme. This scheme allows multiple signers to create a single aggregate public key, and cooperatively create a schnorr signature which is valid under the aggregate public key. This signature can be constructed using k-of-n participants, with k being the minimum number of n participants required to cooperate in order to produce a valid schnorr signature.

=== Specification ===

== Backwards Compatibility ==

This document proposes a standard for the FROST multi-signature scheme that is compatible with [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki BIP340].

FROST is ''not'' compatible with ECDSA signatures traditionally used in Bitcoin.
